# Code of Conduct

Respect to all people who contribute to our project in any way, shape, or form is paramount to our team.

We want participation to be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, and so on.

Unacceptable behaviour includes (but is not limited to):

- the use of sexual language or imagery 
- derogatory comments or personal attacks 
- trolling
- public or private harassment
- any other unprofessional conduct (as determined by project maintainers)

We, as project maintainers, have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

Instances of unacceptable behaviour may be reported by opening an issue or by contacting one or more of the project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/code-of-conduct.html)
